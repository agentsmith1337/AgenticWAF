\end{center}
\vspace{1cm}

\noindent
This project proposes a novel approach to Web Application Firewalls by integrating reflex-agent–based decision making within a reverse proxy architecture. The system operates as middleware, inspecting incoming client requests and autonomously responding to potential threats in real time. Machine learning models are employed to monitor, detect, and act upon malicious patterns in HTTP payloads. As a proof of concept, two common web vulnerabilities-SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) are addressed using Support Vector Machine and Random Forest classifiers, respectively. Experimental evaluation demonstrates detection accuracies of 97\% for SQL Injection and 95\% for XSS, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed agentic framework in enhancing adaptive web application security.
